The following is the current draft of the game's story.

Here I'm going to jot down who people are and where things are so that way I can cleanly come up with a story.

### The Map

The map consists of a number of elements which I've designed whose placement is procedural. At the topmost level the map can be broken down into regions which are governed by the distribution of trees that appear within that region. The behavior of NPC's within the game at the top level are driven by where the boundaries of regions are drawn. Within each region are chunks which are sections of the map made up of a singular type of tree. Within each chunk are clusters which describe specific areas of the map that characters can inhabit; clusters are in some sense the 'pixel' of the map in that nothing can happen in an area more discrete than a cluster.

There are a total of 13 regions in the game: 4 unnamed regions, the `Spirit Realm`, the `Monster's Lair`, the `Merchant's Grove`, `The Oldest Wood`, `The Unspeakable`, the `Memory of the Fallen`, `Valley of Screams`, the `Ancestral Home`, and `Rumble of Beasts`. The map is a loose configuration where the specific position of regions is determined at the start of the game. The template for the map is as follows: A connects to BCI, B connects to ACIJL, C connects to ABIKL, D connects to L, E connects to JLM, F connects to KLM, G connects to HIJM, H connects to GIKM, I connects to ABCGHJK, J connects to BEGILM, K connects to CFHILM, L connects to BCDEFJK, M connects to EFGHJK. The `Spirit Realm`, `Ancestral Home`, and `Merchant's Cove` can be assigned to ABC in any arrangment. The `Monster's Lair` and `Valley of Screams` can be assigned to GH in either order. `The Unspeakable`, `The Oldest Wood`, and the `Memory of the Fallen` can be assigned to DEF in any arrangement as well. The `Rumble of Beasts` is always assigned to I. Without taken into consideration the ways that JKLM can vary or the way that the contents of each of the critical regions can internally vary; the top-level map has 72 possible arrangments which should offer some replay value while preventing regions that shouldn't touch from being adjacent to each other.

### The Player

Within the games are spirits which are entities that can communicate clearly with each other, but struggle to communicate with non-spirits. The player is an example of a spirit, and so is the journal; however, there are going to be VERY few spirits in the game because they'll be hard to make more interactive than the other people. For the most part the player is going to have to get used to being a character with goals that are hard to communicate to the people that they frequently encounter which is to try and match how foreign the world will seem to the player with how foreign it will be to interact with the world.

The player cannot die, but if they are killed then they respawn in a random point on the map at a later point in time. The player has access to an inventory system, but if they die then their items will become encased in a luminescent bush until the player reclaims them.

### The Forest

The forest is an infinite expanse of woods. The place is dominated by a dense boreal wood of pine. Pockets of teak trees dot the area. Hollows made of ash trees are also interspersed in the area. Clearings are far and few between, but their occurance is encircled by willow trees. Elms occur in patchs forming loose lines between different clearings. Areas that the monster frequently explores have become replaced with redwood forestry. Laurel trees crop up in small patches and grow only in areas that the monster will not explore. In addition to the trees, miscelaneous flora will inhabit the area such as flowers, bushes, grasses, roots, and fungi. In addition various rodents, athropods, birds, canines, felines, amphibians, and reptiles inhabit the area.

Distributed throughout the forest are houses, which may be capable of fulfilling other purposes in addition to living domociles. Houses may occur anywhere in any density; however, houses that have skulkers follow a few rules. Skulkers will not occupy a house if there are more than 4 other houses in 60 meters. Skulkers will not occupy a house if it is in an area filled with redwood, elms, or ash trees or within 30 meters of such an area. A house can have no more than 2 skulkers in it. Hermits will occupy houses as long as they satisfy a looser set of rules. Hermits will not occupy a house if there is a skulker in it already. Hermits will not inhabit a house in a redwood area or within 30 meters of a redwood area. A house may contain up to 6 hermits. Nomads will not go into houses but may go near them.

Within the woods are 6 kinds of people that inhabit it. Statues are the people of the woods that have been petrified by monster as a result of resisting the monster's corrupting forces, but are able to weakly communicate with those within their immediate vicinity. Scarecrows are people that have been corrupted by the monster and will wander in the ash hollows or navigate their way to the nearest one. Nomads are people that haven't been corrupted but wander the forest and do not linger in houses, instead retiring to the tops of trees when resting. Hermits are people who wander the forest during the day but hide in vacant houses when sleeping. Skulkers are people that stay in or near a house that they've claimed as their own; fleeing to claim a new house if the monster ever chases them out of their old one. The last type of people that wander the woods are spirits (the player is a spirit) who have a physical manifestation that is vulnerable to being dispelled by the monsters (or by others), but manifest again after some time at a random point in the woods. Unlike the other types, spirits may choose how they go about avoiding the monster.

### The Monster

The monster is an avatar of despair, but he is specific to Silwa, and torments only her. It's name is `Namlkwyzczan`. The name is meant to be evokitive of a creature from eastern european mythology, with influences from creatures such as the bogeyman, woodland spirits, and various mythology surrounding the nature and causes of nightmares.

The player is never able to verify the appearance of the monster, but there are characters in the game that will have encountered the monster or see it pass by, and for their sake I need to devise an appearance. The creature is a mass of pustules filled with miscelaneous fluids that look and smell revolting that vary in color, thickness, and stickiness. The thing moves on a variable number of long, spiked, and spindly legs like a spider. The legs ooze from between its nodules and retract when not in use. It's body lacks any visible sensory organs, but it has perfect information of its surroundings within a 15 meter radius. It cannot speak, but it is able to audibly pulse to express its hatred and disgust at things with a bravado that nauseates those who are within its range of perception. It's true appearance is obscured by a mist (when viewed from 20 meters away) from which arms of varying creatures will reach out to grab and tear at things within it's range. When further than 30 meters but within 60 meters of the creature it's true appearance and surrounding cloud is replaced by the illusion of a victorian era pallbearer with a pale gaunt face.

When nothing of interest is in range it randomly wanders through the forest in search of things to bend to its will. When it detects something it will attempt to grab it and convert it. The arms that reach from it's clouds are illusory and cannot physically grab anything, but they can slow down people and make them feel weak. Once it pins something down with its legs it will deliberately pop some of its pustules to infect its target with the substance that will force its way into any orifices it finds and posesses the target.

Saying it's name outside of a 15 meter radius will attract it's attention and cause it to start moving towards where the name was said, or hasten it's pace if already said. When saying it's name within a 5 meter radius it begins to feel weak. The more repeatedly and passionately the name is said the more intensely and rapidly it will feel weak. When said enough the monster will lose the ability to move, then it's cloud will evaporate, then it's legs will calcify and shatter to dust, then its pustules will shrivel, and finally its body will shrink into nothing.

If the monster is defeated, then a force will radiate outwards relinquishing control from those it perverted. The forest will resume it's natural state along with all it's inhabitants.

### The Lady

The lady's name is Silwa Mateja; however everyone in the town she lives in knows her as Lettie Fischer. A woman whose child died of complications from a genetic disorder, whose husband dissappeared in response to their child's death, and whose friends and family shunned her out of suspicion of her guilt in the loss of her husband and child. In response to the quick destruction of her family followed by the by denail of solidarity amongst her peers. She moved to a new city far from judging eyes and places heavy with memories.

In her new home Silwa tried to settle in and move on, but she kept the mementos of everything she left behind in the attic and hasn't entered it since moving in. She pours all of her energy into her work to keep her mind off things, and consequently she's well regarded by her superiors but her intensity has limited her interactions with her colleagues outside of work.

None of her recreational activities involve leaving town and none of the activities she partakes in involve leaving her own home (unless she's been invited to attend by her colleagues). She hasn't made any friends outside of work and among the great mystersies and sources of gossip around the water cooler is whether she has any past or family as she's expertly coy about both.

Her best friend is a coworker named Tyure who is speculated to be her crush among those who believe she's single. Neither Tyure nor Silwa consider their relationship romantic though many insist otherwise; which is emboldened by their comfort with flirting with each other. Silwa is the most intimate with Tyure (though she won't discuss her past with even him), often discussing her hopes for the future and her interests outside of whatever hobby she's chosen to keep herself busy while at home.

Among the discussions with Tyure she's talked about her dream job of making pianos by hand. She believes that they are the most beautiful instrument to look at and to listen to, and would love to build a piano that someday gets used in some prestigious concert hall by countless pianists long after she's gone. She's had some experience in maintenancing her own piano, and one of the few glimpses of the past that Tyure has been allowed is that she was the de facto piano repair service where she used to live.

Another thing exclusive to Tyure is why Silwa dropped various hobbies. With baking she struggled with finding out too late that a measurement had been imprecise or incorrect and would have to start over, and loathed the cleanup she would have to do afterwards and how little fridge space she had whenever she did it. She had reasonable command of the technique for pottery but never felt satisfied with the result, and when the clay is fired or loses the last of its moisture after a period of time the work becomes fixed and still in need of adjustment. Somewhat abruptly she had quit gardening because she felt emotionally rattled by how frequently her plants would die in spite of her attentiveness and that the only thing that was left alive was a trio of tree saplings in her backyard (which was all she had room for). Breadmaking had seemed like a reasonable compromise from general baking, but she found that none of the bread she could make tasted as good or better than the cheapest variant at her local store and even worse the bread would quickly grow hard or moldy.

Fishing, birdwatching, and equivalently paced activities dropped off in interest after the first couple of successes because the satisfaction of spotting a bird or catching a fish and so on was too fleeting. Painting and drawing are hobbies that she actually enjoys and does every so often; however, there are long stretches of time between when she feels inspired and she's already taken several cracks at drawing everything in her house, the nearby landscapes, and any of her friends who felt comfortable being a subject and sitting still enough for the process. She refuses to take up sewing or knitting in any form and insists that she'll die alone as a sad old cat lady if she even looks too long at a crochet hook.

At the start of the game the game the 2 year anniversary of the death of her son is a week away, and with the approach of this event her emotional state entered a downward spiral and she became more introverted than usual and her pace at work has slowed down. To cap it all off she's begun having nightmares about her past.

### Death of a Child

While the specifics are not important to the identity of Silwa, the specific fashion of her child's death and the response of those around her revealed the nature and extent to which each person was detached from her. Her son had Haemophilia which he didn't inherit from either parent. He was being treated with clotting factor concentrates (CFCs); however at the age of 6 his body developed an inhibitor which prevented the efficacy of the administered concentrates and led to an internal bleed in the brain which proved fatal.

Her husband had been driving him home from a movie when it happened; even though he rushed to the hospital there was nothing they could do when he arrived. The couple entered a period of grief and their friends and family tried to console them. In the case of Silwa she compartmentalized her feelings and avoided talking and thinking about her son as much as possible. Her husband on the other hand turned to alcoholism as a coping mechanism to numb the ache of his loss as he blamed himself as the cause of death.

When her husband dissappeared, because of the difference in how they showed their grief and because the husband's side of the family reflexively blamed her for the loss of their child; people began to suspect foul play. When Silwa compartmentalized even harder and started becoming distant from others to hide her sorrow people assumed that their concerns were true.

When the suspicions escalated to sicking the police on her, Silwa decided that it was too painful to associate with her name, her house, her friends, her family, her job, or the city. She quit her job, changed her name, took her belongings, and moved out of town. When she left everyone assumed that she fled police jurisdiction, but the police had concluded their investigations after finding no evidence of foul play and finding that all of the details regarding her exodus were in legal order. When the sale of her house was finalized by an out of state realtor there were those who doubted that she had any involvement with her husband's dissapearance while others remained certain she was guilty.

## Meanings and Themes

In order to guide the actions of the story I'm going to try my best to give an extra layer of meaning to its elements.

### Who is the Lady

The lady represents trauma; however, she is not defined by her trauma. The whole point of the game is not to show what trauma is, but to measure the way that trauma changes people. She is a person whose had a life of a vast array of experiences up to the point of the loss of her child, but now her loss has colored her memories based on their association with what she's lost, and the abrupt and unceremonial untethering of intimacy with society has uprooted her ability to have new and meaningful experiences.

The takeaway that I hope that players have from the game is that recovering from trauma is a gradual process where victims should not feel helpless for having a support system in place to cope with their experiences, and that victims shouldn't feel like there is a depth or duration of despair that bars them from a path to being a functioning member of society at peace with their past or present suffering.

### What is the Monster

The monster represents the unhealthy views and thoughts that victims of trauma experience either as a natural course of thought or as imposed on them by a society that is unwilling to entertain the notion that there are limitations to which the experiences of a victim of trauma can be parsed and understood by an external observer. It is the amalgamation of despair and helplessness that reduces a person to a husk that is unable to function or connect with others. The monster defeating the monster doesn't mean it goes away, it means that the lady gets to start living her life again equipped with the habits and coping mechanisms necessary to banish the monster whenever it musters its strength.

### Who is the Player

The player is the embodiment of hope; more specifically the player is a manifestation of the lady's attempts to better herself in order to overcome her trauma in order to reclaim her past and live her best future. The player's lack of familiarity with his surroundings is meant to reflect the woman's uncertainty about how to move forward, and the player's fear about the game is meant to reflect the sense of powerlessness that the lady is feeling as they are unable to avoid confronting her trauma any more.

### Where is the Forest

The forest is the lady's perception of the future and her memories. It contains glimmers and hints of the truth, but it is overshadowed and dominated by the monster and it's distortions. The forest is not malevolent in and of itself, but the monster has perverted its state of being to make it hostile towards the player. The state of the forest represents whether the monster or the player is in control. The forest is the metaphorical container for the layer of metaphor that we're going to ask the player to engage in.

### Who Lives in the Forest

Since the forest is a metaphor for the lady's perception of the past and the future and since abstract concepts represented by the player and the monster can inhabit it: the forest will be inhabited by charicatures of people the lady knows as well as various abstract notions and events that the lady is grappling with.
