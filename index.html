            // Website Design Overview
            /*
                The intended behaviours of the site are as follows:
                 - When the site is loaded the player is taken to the splash screen.
                 - The player can either close the window or proceed to the game.
                 - If this is the player's first time loading the site, they're taken to the notice screen.
                 - After continuing from the splash screen or notice screen the player is directed to the game screen.
                 - The game screen's default state is to show the 'the world' page (where the game takes place).
                 - The game screen has a menu that let's the player redirect to other pages in case they want to learn more information, manage their save profiles, or interact with the game in another way.
                 - The journal page gives the player an opportunity to mess around with their recorded progress and hopefully makes them feel more connected to their character's experiences.
                 - The journal also gives the player a handy way to review what they've done.
                 - The journal is also an entity that the player can interact with and have conversations with.
                 - Initially I was going to make it possible to draw in the journal, but that would spike storage requirements too quickly.
                 - The settings page gives the player the ability to change (in a very limited capacity) the look of the website, change the audio settings

                The splash page gives the game a refined look and communicates the game's minimalist appearance. The player is given the option to continue or leave based on how they receive the title screen. But most importantly it allows me to setup my shenannigans behind a loading screen (if necessary).

                The notice page warns users who didn't bother checking the game's description or were given the game file with no explanation as to the following:
                 - What kind of game is this?
                 - What kind of stuff will I find?
                 - How sturdy is this game?
                with the hope that they'll be able to make an informed decision about whether or not they actually want to play this game.

                After the notice page is the main page which really functions as 7:
                 - The World: the default page the player is brought to which is where they actually play the game and interact with the environment.
                 - File Saves: the place where the player can manage save files including importing and exporting game files.
                 - Journal: the place where the player can write down and draw stuff.
                 - Settings: the place where the player either changes the present options or interacts with the game in a radical new way.
                 - Information: the place where the player can read more about the game's internal design.
                 - Help: the place where the player can learn more about how to play the game and what they can interact with, and the games mechanics.
                 - Notice: the player can review the notice if they wish.
                
                The world page consists of 2 parts:
                 - Narrator: this is where the story is described
                 - Options: this is where the player picks what they want to do.

                The file saves page consists of 3 parts:
                 - Create Save: this is where the player can name and create a new save.
                 - Import/Export Save: this is where the player can import or export save profiles.
                 - Load Save: this is where the player can select to load a previous save.
                
                The settings page is a terminal emulator where the player can interface with an unknownn computer system. This system happens to be connected to the mainframe of the facility. The idea is that the player is actually controlling 2 different characters (whether or not they know it). The first character is unfortunately doomed no matter what they do, but it's possible that they can help the second character reach a secret ending that the player has no other way of getting. The terminal is meant to be something that gives replay value to the game because it gives the player a new way to interact with the environment.

                The information is just a scrollable wall of text containing information about the game.

                The help page consists of 2 parts:
                    - Navigation: a banner style menu to select a topic to read about.
                    - Details: text wall for explaining different components of the game.

                The notice page is just a wall of text and some navigation buttons.

            // Local Storage Overview
            /*
                This website uses local storage because it is the class of memory that is as large and as persistent as it can be without prompting the user (which would and should scare them). Since the space is somewhat limited (about 610KB of storage maximum).

                This overview is a work in progress as I develop the game.

                The localstorage is where all immediately accessible data is located. The assumption is that the player will only mess with it if they know what they're doing. The intended structure is as follows:
                 - notice: a boolean tracking whether or not the player has seen the notice.
                 - saves: an object tracking details about all contained save files.
                 - auto: a designated location for saving the current save file.
                 - time: a string tracking the last time the game autosaved.
                 - [0 - 500]: these indices are reserved for save files (but the player will probably exceed the storage limit first).
                
                The structure of the saves object is as follows:
                 - id: an array of save ID numbers.
                 - name: array of player assigned names for the save files.
                 - time: array of dates tracking last time a save was loaded.
                
                The structure of a save file is as follows:
                 - journal: an object tracking the player's progress.

                The structure of a journal object is as follows:
                 - possesion: tracks whether the player has the journal.
                 - entries: a mixture of game and player made notes.
                 - relationship: tracks the nature of the player's relationship with the journal.
                
                The structure of an entry object is a mixed array of player made strings and numbers referencing game text.
